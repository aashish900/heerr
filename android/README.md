# heerr — Android client

Native Android app: search Spotify, dispatch downloads to the home-server backend, watch the queue. Talks REST over Tailscale to the FastAPI service in [`../backend/`](../backend/).

> **Status (2026-06-09):** planning complete. Flutter project itself does not exist yet — `android/app/` is created at milestone A1. Until then this README is forward-looking; commands marked **(post-A1)** won't work yet.

## What it does

1. Settings screen: paste backend URL (`http://<tailscale-host>:8000/api/v1`) + bearer token (minted by the backend CLI). "Test connection" hits `/health`.
2. Search screen: type / album / playlist search via the backend's `/search`.
3. Tap a result → backend dispatches the download (`/download`) → Navidrome auto-indexes the file on the home server within ~1 min.
4. Queue + job-detail screens poll `/queue` and `/status/{id}` to show what's in flight.

What it explicitly does **not** do (see `docs/PLAN.md` §11): Spotify SDK / OAuth on device, push notifications, biometric unlock, light theme, iOS port, admin endpoints, internationalisation.

## Stack

Locked v1 — full rationale in `docs/DECISIONLOG.md`:

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| State management | `flutter_riverpod` + codegen |
| HTTP | `dio` with auth-injecting interceptor |
| JSON | `freezed` + `json_serializable` + `build_runner` |
| Token storage | `flutter_secure_storage` |
| Navigation | `go_router` |
| Theme | Material 3, dark, seed `#1DB954` |

---

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Flutter SDK | 3.44.0 stable | `flutter --version`. User has it at `~/develop/flutter`. |
| Dart | 3.12.0 | Bundled with Flutter 3.44.0. |
| Android SDK | 36.1.0 | Via Android Studio; cmdline-tools + licenses accepted. |
| `adb` | from platform-tools | On PATH at `~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools`. |
| Test device | Pixel 7, Android 16 (API 36) | Connected over wireless adb (`adb pair` → `adb connect`). |

Already set up + smoke-tested per root `CONTEXT.md`. The Flutter starter app builds and runs on the Pixel — confirmed before the planning round.

## Quick start — once A1 lands

**(post-A1 — won't work until milestone A1 ships):**

```bash
# from repo root
cd android/app
flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs   # generates freezed + json + riverpod
flutter run -d <device-id>                                        # `flutter devices` to list
```

Open the Settings screen on first launch, paste the backend URL + token, hit "Test connection" → expect "ok".

---

## Configuring the app

Two values, entered once on the Settings screen, persisted to `flutter_secure_storage`:

| Field | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Backend base URL | `http://100.106.120.121:8000/api/v1` | Tailscale IP or MagicDNS name + `:8000` + `/api/v1`. Trailing slash trimmed automatically. |
| Bearer token | `rXq…` (raw output of `create-token`) | Minted on the backend: `python -m app.cli create-token --owner=phone --scopes=read,download`. |

No `.env` files. No `--dart-define`. Settings → Save persists; the dio client provider invalidates and rebuilds with the new values.

---

## Development commands

**(post-A1):**

```bash
cd android/app

flutter analyze                                # lint
flutter test                                   # unit + widget tests
flutter pub run build_runner watch \
  --delete-conflicting-outputs                 # codegen on edit
flutter run -d <device-id>                     # hot-reload dev loop
```

The CI workflow on `main` runs `flutter analyze` + `flutter test` for every PR touching `android/**` (added at a Flutter-CI milestone post-G1; planning-round scope only).

## Building a release APK

### One-time setup — generate the signing keystore

Android refuses to install an unsigned APK. The keystore + its passwords are **gitignored** and must live on your dev machine only. **Generate once, keep forever** — if you lose them you can't ship an update of this app over an existing install (you'd have to uninstall + reinstall, which clears the app's secure storage).

1. **Generate the keystore.** From the repo root:

   ```bash
   keytool -genkey -v \
     -keystore android/app/android/keystore.jks \
     -alias heerr \
     -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 \
     -validity 10000
   ```

   `keytool` ships with the JDK (Android Studio installs it). It will prompt for:

   - **Keystore password** (twice). Pick a strong one and save it in your password manager.
   - **Distinguished-name fields** (CN, OU, O, L, ST, C). For a personal sideload these can be anything — `heerr / personal / aashish / na / na / IN` is fine. They show up in the cert if anyone inspects the APK; not user-facing.
   - **Key password** (twice). Pressing Enter reuses the keystore password — recommended.

   Output: `android/app/android/keystore.jks` (gitignored). Lock-icon the file in Finder if you want.

2. **Create `key.properties`.** Copy the example and fill in the passwords from step 1:

   ```bash
   cp android/app/android/key.properties.example android/app/android/key.properties
   # then edit android/app/android/key.properties:
   #   storePassword=<the one you typed at the keytool prompt>
   #   keyPassword=<same as storePassword if you pressed Enter>
   #   keyAlias=heerr
   #   storeFile=keystore.jks
   ```

   Also gitignored. `storeFile` is resolved relative to `android/app/android/`.

3. **Verify the keystore.** Quick sanity check:

   ```bash
   keytool -list -v -keystore android/app/android/keystore.jks -alias heerr
   ```

   Should print the cert fingerprint without errors.

### Build + install

```bash
cd android/app
flutter build apk --release
# → build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk

adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

If `key.properties` is missing, Gradle silently falls back to the debug key. That APK installs but is **not shippable** — it'll get refused as an "update" of any real release-signed install and is rejected by the Play Store. The build log shows `signingConfig signingConfigs.debug` in that case; check it before declaring a build "release".

### What's gitignored

- `android/app/android/keystore.jks`
- `android/app/android/key.properties`
- Any `**/*.jks` anywhere in the tree (belt + suspenders).
