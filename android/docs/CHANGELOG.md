## 2026-06-09 — Android client planning round

- New: `android/CLAUDE.md` — Android-app-specific Claude rules (bootstrap order, locked stack, TDD scope, "don't"s, user-background reminder).
- New: `android/README.md` — operational entry point for the Android app. Stub at this point — points at `docs/` and notes that the scaffold itself lands at milestone A1.
- New: `android/docs/CONTEXT.md` — Android client project brief (backend endpoints consumed, stack, dev env, target device, MVP screens, polling cadence, error UX, out-of-scope list).
- New: `android/docs/PLAN.md` — frozen v1 contract (stack table, project layout, API contract, configuration, routing, state management, theme, polling cadence, error UX, tests, out-of-scope list, definition-of-done).
- New: `android/docs/ROADMAP.md` — 13-milestone build sequence (A1–G1) mirroring the backend's A1–H1 cadence. Halt-and-confirm at each boundary.
- New: `android/docs/DECISIONLOG.md` — 5 seed ADRs locking the stack, theme, polling-not-WebSocket, in-app Settings (not `--dart-define`), and the `android/app/` project layout.
- New: `android/docs/CHANGELOG.md` — this file.
- Rationale: same convention as backend — get the contract locked in writing before any Dart code. Reading the ROADMAP gives the next task; reading PLAN.md tells you what's already decided so you don't re-litigate.
- **Note:** the `android/app/` directory does not exist yet. `flutter create android/app` is the first action of milestone A1.

## 2026-06-09 — Rename: `flutter/` → `android/`

- The directory holding the mobile-client docs (and, later, the `flutter create` scaffold at `app/`) is renamed from `flutter/` to `android/`. The convention `<app>/` from the root `/CLAUDE.md` still applies — `<app>` here is `android`.
- Rationale: `flutter` named the framework, not the role. The pair `backend/` + `flutter/` was inconsistent (backend isn't called `fastapi/`). `android/` names the deployment platform — Flutter is still the framework used to build the app, but iOS is explicitly out of scope (per `/CLAUDE.md` §3), so the dir name reflects the only target the user ships to.
- Trade-off: the inner `flutter create` scaffold (landing at A1) will create its own `android/` subdir for the Android build manifest + Gradle config — so paths like `android/app/android/AndroidManifest.xml` will exist. Annoying-but-harmless path repetition; accepted at rename time after the preview was shown.
- Path refs updated throughout `android/CLAUDE.md`, `android/README.md`, `android/docs/{CONTEXT,PLAN,ROADMAP,DECISIONLOG,CHANGELOG}.md`, root `/CLAUDE.md`, and two stale forward-references in `backend/docs/CHANGELOG.md` (per CLAUDE.md staleness rule).
- Project-noun refs ("the Flutter app", "Flutter client", file titles) updated to "Android client" / "Android app" / similar. Framework refs (Flutter SDK, Flutter 3.44.0, `flutter create`, `flutter analyze`, `flutter_secure_storage`, "the Flutter team") left intact — Flutter is still the framework even though the dir is named for the platform.
- Root `/CLAUDE.md`: app inventory + the "Backend first, Flutter second" rule reworded to "Backend first, Android client second" with a clarifying parenthetical noting the framework/platform split.
- Nothing else moved; no Dart code yet — this is purely a docs rename.
